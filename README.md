## Hardware Requirements

* Display with a resolution of **1920x1080** or higher
* about 1.5 GB of memory for a 32 tick demo
* about 5 GB of memory for a 128 tick demo

## Windows Installation

I did not sign the application - Windows *will* prevent the app from running. [Here is a video](https://streamable.com/y24mq) that shows how to install and use csgoverview.

1. Download latest version from the [releases
   page](https://github.com/Linus4/csgoverview/releases).
1. Create a folder and extract `csgoverview.exe` into it.
1. Create a folder called 'csgoverview' in your user directory. (e.g.
   `C:\Users\Username\csgoverview`)
1. Move the `.ttf` file from the .zip archive into the csgoverview folder.
1. Download the overview images from [this
   repository](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews) and put them
   into the csgoverview folder.
1. Right click a demo and select 'Open with' to open it with csgoverview.

## Linux Installation

#### Fedora

```sh
dnf install git golang SDL2{,_gfx,_image,_ttf}-devel dejavu-sans-fonts
```

#### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install git golang libsdl2{,-gfx,-image,-ttf}-dev fonts-dejavu
```

### Build

This project uses go modules. Make sure you have go version `1.12` or higher
installed. Run `go version` to check.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Linus4/csgoverview.git
cd csgoverview
go build
```

### Executable

You can move or symlink the executable into a directory in your `$PATH` to make
the program available everywhere on your system.

Example:

```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/csgoverview <path to cloned repository>/csgoverview
```

### Desktop file (Linux)

In order to add csgoverview to your applications menu, create a `.desktop`
file (use the path to the executable on your computer in Exec):

```sh
echo "[Desktop Entry]
Name=CSGOverview
Exec=/usr/bin/csgoverview %F
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Games;" > $HOME/.local/share/applications/csgoverview.desktop
```

## Get overviews

Use [this repository](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews)
(overviews directory), create a directory with `mkdir
$HOME/.local/share/csgoverview`  and copy the overviews that you need to
`$HOME/.local/share/csgoverview`.

You can use other overviews as long as they are `.jpg` files and they match the
naming pattern (e.g. `de_nuke.jpg`). Ideally, their size should be 1024x1024
pixels or larger.

More overviews are available here:

* [alternative generated from game
  files](https://github.com/CSGO-Analysis/csgo-maps-overviews)
* [Simple Radar](www.simpleradar.com)

On Linux, you can convert images with `convert image.png image.jpg` if you
have `ImageMagick` installed.

## Usage

```sh
./csgoverview
    -fontpath string
    	Path to font file (.ttf) (default "/usr/share/fonts/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf")
    -framerate float
    	Fallback GOTV Framerate (default -1)
    -overviewdir string
        Path to overview directory (default "$HOME/.local/share/csgoverview")
    -tickrate float
    	Fallback Gameserver Tickrate (default -1)

  [path to demo]
```

If you're using GTK, you can also double-click the executable and select a
demo with the GUI.

After you've created the `.desktop` file, you can right click on a demo and
select csgoverview when you select 'Open With'. This way, you can just
double-click on a demo to watch it with csgoverview.

## Cross-compiling

Using a Fedora 30 machine:

#### Dependencies

```sh
sudo dnf install make git golang SDL2{,_gfx,_image,_ttf,_mixer} mingw64-SDL2{,_image,_ttf}
```

#### Installing SDL2_gfx library

```sh
wget http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL2_gfx/SDL2_gfx-1.0.4.tar.gz
tar xf SDL2_gfx-1.0.4.tar.gz
cd SDL2_gfx-1.0.4
mingw64-configure
mingw64-make
sudo mingw64-make install
cd ..
```

#### Cloning the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Linus4/csgoverview.git
cd csgoverview
```

#### Build

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -tags static -ldflags "-s -w"
```

#### Required files

Put the font file (`.ttf`) from the repository and the required map overviews
(next section) into a folder called 'csgoverview' in the user-directory
(`C:\Users\Name\csgoverview`). You can launch the application from the
command-line or right-clicking a demo file and selecting 'Open with' to open
the file with csgoverview.
